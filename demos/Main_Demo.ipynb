        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](https://neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

From a computational perspective, we know exactly what operations are going on inside (even if we don't know what they mean!).

This is an extremely powerful tool, because it can let us eg set up careful counterfactuals and causal intervention to easily understand model behaviour.\n",

They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",

        "**Gotcha:** Hooks are global state - they're added in as part of the model, and stay there until removed. `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state, by removing all hooks at the end of the function. But you can easily shoot yourself in the foot if there's, eg, an error in one of your hooks so the function never finishes. If you start getting bugs, try `model.reset_hooks()` to clean things up. Further, if you *do* add hooks of your own that you want to keep, which you can do with `add_perma_hook` on the relevant HookPoint"

The goal is to identify which model activations are important for completing a task. We do this by setting up a **clean prompt** and a **corrupted prompt** and a **metric** for performance on the task. We then pick a specific model activation, run the model on the corrupted prompt, but then *intervene* on that activation and patch in its value when run on the clean prompt. We then apply the metric, and see how much this patch has recovered the clean performance.\n",

The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "For a more involved example, let's look at the eigenvalue copying score from [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) of the OV circuit for various heads. The OV Circuit for a head (the factorised matrix $W_OV = W_V W_O$) is a linear map that determines what information is moved from the source position to the destination position. Because this is low rank, it can be thought of as *reading in* some low rank subspace of the source residual stream and *writing to* some low rank subspace of the destination residual stream (with maybe some processing happening in the middle).\n",
        "\n",
        "A common operation for this will just be to *copy*, ie to have the same reading and writing subspace, and to do minimal processing in the middle. Empirically, this tends to coincide with the OV Circuit having (approximately) positive real eigenvalues. I mostly assert this as an empirical fact, but intuitively, operations that involve mapping eigenvectors to different directions (eg rotations) tend to have complex eigenvalues. And operations that preserve eigenvector direction but negate it tend to have negative real eigenvalues. And \"what happens to the eigenvectors\" is a decent proxy for what happens to an arbitrary vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can get a score for \"how positive real the OV circuit eigenvalues are\" with $\\frac{\\sum \\lambda_i}{\\sum |\\lambda_i|}$, where $\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the OV circuit. This is a bit of a hack, but it seems to work well in practice."

They find a pretty dramatic shift in models during training - there's a brief period where models go from not having induction heads to having them, which leads to the models suddenly becoming much better at in-context learning (using far back tokens to predict the next token, eg over 500 words back). This is enough of a big deal that it leads to a visible *bump* in the loss curve, where the model's rate of improvement briefly increases."
